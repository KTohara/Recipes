      <div class="description">
        <p>A cool and refreshing dish. Fairytale eggplant are lovely mini eggplant, only 4 inches long! They hold vibrant white streaks within it's vibrant lavender body and tend to be just a bit more tender than it's bigger cousins.</p>
        <p>The dish comes from mediterranean backgrounds, black urfa chili oil; a deeply savory, not-so-spicy chili of Turkish descent. It has accents of cocoa, raisin, with hints of earth and smoke. The labneh is whipped with sumac; a tangy, citrus-like spice also from Turkey, that brings brightness and acidity without the usage of lemons.</p>
