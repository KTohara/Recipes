        <h2 class="food-title">Directions</h2>
        
        <p class="list-title">Gnocchi:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Set oven to 450F (232C). Pierce potatoes with fork all over. Set potatoes on wire rack over a baking sheet. Bake until completely tender when pierced with a fork. About 45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Slice potatoes in half. Scoop them out into a ricer or food mill. If none are available, use a cheese grater as a last resort on the second to smallest hole.</li>
          <li>Spread riced potatoes into an even layer to allow the steam to escape.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, beat 1 egg, and drizzle the egg mixture on the potatoes using a fork. Season potatoes with salt and white pepper.</li>
          <li>Dust potatoes with the 1/3 cup of flour.</li>
          <li>Using a bench scraper, cut the potato mixture and chop the flour and egg into the potato. Use the bench scraper to gather up the potato dough, and knead the dough into a dough, gently pressing down and then folding it in half. Repeat for 3 minutes or so. Use flour liberally if the dough sticks.</li>
          <li>Form dough into a large bread-like log. Dust with flour. Cover and let rest 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Slice off 1 inch portions of the log, and roll them into smaller 1/2 inch thick snake-like logs. Slice them into 1 inch pieces using the bench scraper. Use a very small amount of flour to prevent sticking.</li>
          <li>Transfer all gnocchi into a lined baking sheet dusted with flour.</li>
          <li>Gnocchi may be frozen by placing on a SINGLE layer. Once frozen, break them apart and place into a ziploc bag. Keep frozen for 1 month.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="list-title">Sage Cremini:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Slice mushrooms 1/8 inch thick.</li>
          <li>Smash all garlic cloves.</li>
          <li>Preheat pan on high.</li>
          <li>Add mushrooms. Add EVOO after 30 seconds. Do not season mushrooms yet. Add garlic after mushrooms have evaporated most of it's moisture, and gained a little bit of color.</li>
          <li>Add sage and cook for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Once mushrooms have crisped and gained a nice golden brown color, kill the heat, and add the butter, salt and pepper. Mix, and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="list-title">Lemon Ricotta:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Add ricotta, lemon zest of 1 lemon, lemon juice of half of lemon, salt, and pepper into a bowl. Mix thoroughly.</li>
          <li>Add EVOO to finish.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="list-title">Cooking the Gnocchi:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Boil water with 2 Tbsp salt.</li>
          <li>Add gnocchi. Wait till they float to the top.</li>
          <li>Skim out gnocchi, drain.</li>
          <li>To plate, place gnocchi on plate, add cremini mushrooms on top, with a dollop of ricotta atop the mushrooms. Garnish with EVOO and sage.</li>
