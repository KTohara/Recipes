        <p>Soft tender calamari with roasted eggplant covered in chili oil. This flavorful oil is a staple of the Szechuan region which gives its mouth-numbing qualities from Szechuan peppercorns.</p>
        <p>Chili oil may seem daunting to make at first, but once you understand the key steps, it's a ten minute process that results in an amazing product with robust fragrance, nuttiness and smokiness!</p>

        <p class="list-title">Chili Oil:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Grab a small sauce pot and slowly heat 1 cup of oil, until 370F (190C). If it reaches 370F while the rest of the recipe is being prepared, bring down the temperature to the lowest flame possible.</li>
          <li>While the oil is heating, mince garlic and ginger and set aside in a heat proof bowl.</li>
          <li>Toast star anise, Szechuan peppercorns and corriander in a skillet for 1 minute on low-medium heat, until aromatic.</li>
          <li>Grind Szechuan peppercorns and corriander in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder.</li>
          <li>Place all ingredients (except the oil) in heat proof bowl along with your minced garlic and ginger</li>
          <li>Make sure the oil reaches around 370F again, and then pour the oil slowly into the bowl. The chilis will sizzle and infuse the flavors into the oil.</li>
          <li>Place into a tightly sealed container and keep refrigerated for up to two months.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="list-title">Squid and Eggplant:</p>

          <li>Slice eggplant on a bias about 1/2 inch thick. Set Aside.</li>
          <li>Chiffonade thai basil. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Set skillet to high heat, and after 30 seconds, add 2 Tbsp of oil.</li>
          <li>Sear the eggplant flesh side down. Add a dash of salt. Sear 1.5 minutes. Sear on other side for an additional 1.5 minutes. Set eggplant aside.</li>
